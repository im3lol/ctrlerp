Task: Implement product detail page, stock transfer form page, barcode scanning, and navigation improvements

Work Log:
- Updated `src/lib/store.ts` to add `selectedItemId`, `selectedTransferId`, and their setters
- Created `src/components/inventory/item-detail-page.tsx` - Full-page product detail with back navigation, product info, codes, linked records (sales/purchases/movements/adjustments), stock balances table
- Created `src/components/inventory/stock-transfer-form-page.tsx` - Full-page stock transfer form with barcode scanning support, warehouse hierarchy selection, dual mode (create/view)
- Updated `src/components/inventory/items-list.tsx` - Removed detail dialog popup, replaced with page navigation via `setSelectedItemId` + `setView('item-detail')`
- Updated `src/components/inventory/stock-transfers-list.tsx` - Create/view buttons now navigate to `stock-transfer-form` page instead of opening dialogs
- Updated `src/app/page.tsx` - Added imports for `ItemDetailPage` and `StockTransferFormPage`, added route cases for `item-detail` and `stock-transfer-form` views, added view titles

Stage Summary:
- Product click → navigates to full detail page (not popup)
- Stock transfer create/view → navigates to full form page (not popup)
- Barcode scanning in stock transfer form auto-adds items on Enter key
- Warehouse selectors show full hierarchy path (Warehouse → Zone → Rack → Shelf → Box)
- All transfers support any location type (box→box, warehouse→warehouse, etc.)
- Lint passes, dev server running successfully

Work Log:
- Updated `src/app/api/inventory/delivery-notes/route.ts`:
  - GET: Added `salesOrder` include (select: id, number) to list query
  - POST: Added `salesOrderId` destructuring from body; added salesOrderId validation block that fetches the sales order, validates company ownership, and auto-fills customerId if not already set by salesInvoiceId; added `salesOrderId: salesOrderId || null` to create data; added `salesOrder` include in response
- Updated `src/app/api/inventory/delivery-notes/[id]/route.ts`:
  - GET: Added `salesOrder` include (select: id, number) to single query
  - PUT: Added `salesOrder` include (select: id, number) to all update responses (confirm, cancel CONFIRMED, cancel DRAFT)
- Updated `src/components/inventory/delivery-notes-list.tsx` with all 8 requirements:
  1. localStorage support: Added useEffect on mount that checks `pendingDeliveryNote` in localStorage, parses JSON, pre-fills create form (warehouseId empty, salesOrderId from order, customerId from order, lines with remaining qty), opens create dialog automatically, clears localStorage key
  2. salesOrderId in createForm state: Added `salesOrderId: ''` to createForm initial state
  3. Sales Order dropdown in create dialog: Added new Select field for choosing a Sales Order, shows only CONFIRMED orders, when selected fetches order details from `/api/sales/orders/[id]?companyId=X`, auto-fills customerId and lines (quantity = ordered - delivered), sets salesOrderId, "بدون أمر بيع" option; mutually exclusive with Sales Invoice selection
  4. salesOrderId in POST body: Added `salesOrderId: createForm.salesOrderId || undefined` to create request body
  5. Linked Sales Order in view dialog: Added "أمر البيع" field showing `selectedNote.salesOrder?.number || '—'`
  6. Updated DeliveryNote type: Added `salesOrderId: string | null` and `salesOrder?: { id: string; number: string }`
  7. fetchSalesOrders function: Added `fetchSalesOrders` useCallback that fetches from `/api/sales/orders?companyId=X&status=CONFIRMED`
  8. Table column: Added "أمر البيع" column showing `note.salesOrder?.number || '—'` between "فاتورة البيع" and "عدد الأصناف"
- Additional changes:
  - Added `SalesOrder` and `SalesOrderLine` interfaces
  - Added `salesOrders` state and `orderLoading` state
  - Added `handleSalesOrderChange` async handler (mirrors handleSalesInvoiceChange pattern)
  - Updated customer select to be disabled when salesOrderId is set (in addition to salesInvoiceId)
  - Updated line editing disabled conditions to include salesOrderId
  - Updated auto-fill messages from "من الفاتورة" to "من المستند المحدد"
  - Sales Invoice select is disabled when Sales Order is selected, and vice versa
