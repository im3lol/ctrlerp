Task: Fix notifications system - Sonner Toaster not rendered in layout

Work Log:
- Found that layout.tsx imported Toaster from @/components/ui/toaster (Radix/shadcn)
- But all business components use `import { toast } from 'sonner'` (Sonner library)
- The Sonner Toaster was never mounted in the layout, so all toast calls disappeared
- Replaced the import to use @/components/ui/sonner instead
- Enhanced Sonner Toaster with position="top-center", dir="rtl", richColors, closeButton

Stage Summary:
- Notifications now work correctly with Sonner toast system
- All toast.success() / toast.error() calls throughout the app will now render

Task: Fix company name not updating in header

Work Log:
- Investigated the store update chain: company-form.tsx -> updateCompany() -> store -> header
- The updateCompany() method in the store correctly updates the companies array
- The header reads from companies.find((c) => c.id === currentCompanyId)?.nameAr
- The main issue was that toasts weren't showing (Bug 1), so users thought it didn't save
- Also fixed: company-form useEffect now has [companyId] dependency (was empty [])
- Also fixed: setLoading(true) added when companyId changes so form shows loading state

Stage Summary:
- Company name now updates immediately in the header when saved
- Toast notifications now confirm the save operation
- Form properly refreshes when switching between companies
